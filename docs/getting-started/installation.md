# Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Heads up**: Our documentation has moved -- you can find the new docs at [https://docs.errata.ai/vale/install](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/install)
{% endhint %}

## Remote, collaborative use[¶](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/#remote-collaborative-use)

One of Vale's strengths is its ability to help a company, project, or organization maintain consistency \(capitalization styles, word choice, brand terminology, spelling, etc.\) across multiple writers.

The benefits of these installation methods are that every writer has access to the same Vale configuration without having to install and configure the tool themselves.

### **Using Vale with GitHub**

If you want to lint the contents of a GitHub repository, the recommended approach is to use Vale's [official GitHub Action](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action).

### **Using Vale with a continuous integration \(CI\) service**

If you want to use Vale with a CI service such as Travis CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins, the recommended approach is to use Vale's [`GoDownloader`](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader) script \(Vale will be installed to `/bin/vale`\):

```bash
$ curl -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/ValeLint/vale.sh | sh -s vX.Y.Z
$ export PATH="./bin:$PATH"
$ vale -v
```

where `vX.Y.Z` is your version of choice from the [releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases). This will ensure that your CI builds are consistent and allow you to update versions on an opt-in basis.

## Local use by a single writer[¶](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/#local-use-by-a-single-writer)

Vale can also be used locally by a single writer through the command line or a third-party integration.

### **Using Vale with a text editor \(or another third-party application\)**

Vale has a commercial desktop application, [Vale Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), that integrates with [many third-party applications](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/usage#step-5-using-a-client-application) \(including Atom, Sublime Text, VS Code, and Google Docs\) and allows writers to easily create and switch between multiple local Vale configurations.
