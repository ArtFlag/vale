Vale is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. It's cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), written in Go, and released under the MIT license.

## Funding

If you'd like to support the continued development and support of Vale, you may contribute financially by doing any of the following:

- Purchasing a license (Individual or Enterprise) for [Vale Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), a cross-platform desktop application for Vale that introduces a number of style-management features and integration options.

- Making a recurring pledge or a one-time donation through the [Open Source Collective [501(c)(6)]](https://opencollective.com/vale).

Both of these options allow me ([@jdkato](https://github.com/jdkato)) to dedicate more time to *maintaining* (e.g., bug fixes, feature requests, support questions, and documentation improvements) Vale and its collection of open-source and permissively-licensed [styles](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles), integrations, and extensions.
