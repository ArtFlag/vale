Vale is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. It's cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), written in Go, and released under the MIT license. Some of its key features are:

* [Markup support](https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/markup): Vale supports HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, XML, and DITA&mdash;allowing it to avoid most syntax-related false positives while also providing .

* [Extensibility](https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/styles): Unlike most writing-related software, Vale's primary purpose isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to enforce an existing style guide through its YAML-based extension system.

* [Performance](https://gist.github.com/jdkato/02bb9db72cf6d36c7a52d8b075bdb5df#file-perf-md): Vale typically takes less than 1 second to lint most files, making it fast enough to be included in test suites for large \(&gt; 1,000 files\) repositories.

See the [documentation](https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/) for more information.

## Funding

If you'd like to support the continued development and support of Vale, you may contribute financially by doing any of the following:

- Purchasing a license (Individual or Enterprise) for [Vale Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), a cross-platform desktop application for Vale that introduces a number of style-management features and integration options.

- Making a recurring pledge or a one-time donation through the [Open Source Collective [501(c)(6)]](https://opencollective.com/vale).

Both of these options allow me ([@jdkato](https://github.com/jdkato)) to dedicate more time to *maintaining* (e.g., bug fixes, feature requests, support questions, and documentation improvements) Vale and its collection of open-source and permissively-licensed [styles](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles), integrations, and extensions.
